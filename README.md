# Forest Landscape Analysis

Python tools for analyzing forest landscape dynamics, fragmentation, and ecological metrics from remote sensing data.

## Overview

This project provides computational tools for:

- Analyzing land use changes from remote sensing data
- Quantifying forest fragmentation patterns
- Computing spatial metrics for landscape analysis
- Performing principal component analysis (PCA) on landscape variables
- Visualizing ecological data and landscape dynamics

The tools are based on methodologies used in studies of forest landscapes in the Western Ghats of India, particularly focusing on the Uttara Kannada district.

## Research Background

This project is inspired by research on forest landscape dynamics and fragmentation in the Western Ghats of India, particularly:

- Ramachandra TV, Bharath S (2018) Geoinformatics based Valuation of Forest Landscape Dynamics in Central Western Ghats, India
- Ramachandra TV, Bharath Setturu and Subash Chandran (2016) Geospatial analysis of forest fragmentation in Uttara Kannada District, India
